# DJ_app_OtoDecks
DJ app developed during my studies in Object Oriented Programming.

The app was developed using C++ with the JUCE Framework library. JUCE enabled us to develop audio functionalities,
and also provide a GUI interface which one can customise.

For the code to run, one needs to install the JUCE Framework library together with the Projucer.

Further information on how to install and setup the JUCE Framework may be found in the following link.
